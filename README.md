## Description
For this project i was given starter code for this Book Search engine.I set up an apollo server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data.I also modified the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

## Usage 
This Book search engine allows users to create an account and login.Once signed in users can save and delete there favorite books.This is a great way for users to have an organized list of there favorite books.Users can use the search bar to search any book they desire. Once searched users will be prompt with the results in a card with a image of the cover and a description of the book.
